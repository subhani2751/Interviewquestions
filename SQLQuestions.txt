1)What is SQL, and what is it used for?
 SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language for managing and manipulating relational databases. It’s used to create, read, update, and delete data (CRUD operations), as well as manage database structures like tables and indexes.

2)What’s the difference between SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE?
  SELECT :-  Retrieves data from a table, select is a pysical command beacuse it wouldn't effect database tables
		EX :- SELECT * FROM Employees
  INSERT:- Adds new data to a table
		EX :- INSERT INTO Employees (Name, Age) VALUES ('John', 30)
  UPDATE:- Modifies existing data
		EX :- UPDATE Employees SET Age = 31 WHERE Name = 'John'
  DELETE: Removes data from a table
		EX :- DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Name = 'John'
		
3)What is a primary key, and why is it important?
 A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table, it don't duplicates, and is used to establish relationships with other tables.
 
4)What is a foreign key?
  it is usefull to creating a relationship between tables, A foreign key is a field in one table that links to the primary key in another table

5)What’s the difference between WHERE and HAVING in SQL?
	WHERE :- WHERE clause filters rows data before grouping 
	HAVING :-  HAVING clause filters data after grouping, used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM  and grouping clause

6)What are aggregate functions in SQL? Give examples?
	Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value
		EX :- COUNT(): Counts rows (COUNT(*) FROM Employees).
			  SUM(): Sums numeric values (SUM(Salary) FROM Employees).
			  AVG(): Calculates the average (AVG(Age) FROM Employees).
			  MAX()/MIN(): Finds the highest/lowest value (MAX(Salary) FROM Employees).

7)What is the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN?
	INNER JOIN :- Returns only matching records from both tables 
	LEFT JOIN :- Returns all records from the left table, with NULLs for non-matching right table records.
	RIGHT JOIN :- Returns all records from the right table, with NULLs for non-matching left table records.
	
8)How do you write a query to find duplicate records in a table?
	Use GROUP BY and HAVING to identify duplicates:
		SELECT Email, COUNT(*) FROM Users 
		GROUP BY Email 
		HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

9)What is an index, and why use it?
	An index is a data structure (like a book’s index) that improves query performance by speeding up data retrieval. However, it can slow down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.
	EX :- CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON Employees(Name);

10)What is a subquery, and when would you use it?
	A subquery is a query nested inside another query. Query execuition starts from nested query
		EX :- SELECT Name FROM Employees 
			  WHERE DepartmentID IN (SELECT ID FROM Departments WHERE Location = 'New York');
11)Write a query to find the top 5 highest-paid employees in a company?
		SELECT Name, Salary FROM Employees 
		ORDER BY Salary DESC 
		LIMIT 5
12)What’s the difference between TRUNCATE and DELETE?
	TRUNCATE:- Removes all rows from a table but keeps the structure (faster, no rollback possible).
	DELETE:- Removes specific rows (slower, can be rolled back, supports WHERE clause).
13)How do you handle NULL values in SQL?
	Use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL to check for NULLs.
	Use COALESCE or IFNULL to replace NULL with a default value.
	EX:- SELECT COALESCE(ManagerID, 0) AS ManagerID FROM Employees;
